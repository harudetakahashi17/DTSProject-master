                    House of Haviks orginally a farming and crafting focus guild. We gather resources, craft, and sell it for silver or share it with guildmates.
                    Why gathering? Because we need develop our island and guild island. We need to construct buildings for our nececities. It could be useful for
                    saving some money if you want to craft something. Also gathering and craftin can help you gaining farm and craft skill tree. Which is you can
                    craft and gather higher tier resources. You can sell raw resources for a bag of silver. The higher tier materials you have, the more silver you
                    can get. Beside selling, you also can share with guild to help guild island development.
                </p>

                    PvE (Player vs Environtment) is another way to having fun. You may get bored doing farm/craft things, relief some stress and beat up some monsterous
                    creatures. Our member are always on in Discord, whenever you need help for group dungeon just ask and we'll gladly help you. Our PvE contents is not
                    only in blue zone or yellow zone, for advance PvE we also went into black zone dungeons for fame farming. It's the best way to gain fame for your
                    combat skill.

                    Want some challenge? You can count on us. We may a small guild but we can take down 2 or more person from bigger guild such as ARCH alliance or else.
                    This is how you play Albion, you protect friends and kill everyone who try to kill you. It's about kill or be killed. The more you kill enemies the more
                    you get rewards. We always do group ganking since our guild is a small guild. Even bigger guild also did group ganking in black zone. We try to protect
                    our guild member activity in black zone so they can freely roam or gathering resource in black zone.
